# Nanors #

nanors is meant to be a simple software wallet that works with the [Nano network](https://nano.org/). I have been working on this project in order to learn more about cryptography, cryptocurrency, Nano and programming in Rust. 

------


Wallet operations are preformed within the [tokio runtime](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio).

All account balances are currently in raw.


-------

## Usage

`cargo run`

or 

`cargo build --release` and run executable in target directory. 

---------

## Features
- seed and account generation
- transacting on accounts 
- local block signing
- local proof of work 
- local wallet encryption (aes_gcm)
- rpc client for interacting with the network
- websocket client for observing the network.
- raw/MNano unit conversion 
  
## Roadmap
- account work caching with tasks.
- bip39 and seed import
- CLI, manager, wallet in separate project
- wallet file convention, use OS app dir.
- handle sigterm in CLI send, change
- CLI set manager node.
